If working on school desktop, must run open_WECSIM.m before running any simulations. After done working, must run close_WECSIM.m. 

If working on personal device, map WEC-Sim folder to your MATLAB path, should be pretty straightforward. 

See the User Manual Page "Getting Started" for more info. Link: https://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/main/user/getting_started.html
